# Day of Code
This is some example code to get you started with Mocha, either with CoffeeScript or with plain JavaScript.

Install dependencies with:

	npm install

The fizzbuzz and the tests (and linter) can be run with:

	npm test

If you want to run the plain JS version simply type:

    mocha -R spec test*.js
